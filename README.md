# Gitlab Integration Plugin

Lets you interact with gitlab from within your IDE.

Features:
<ul>
    <li>List projects (by namespaces) and their issues</li>
    <li>Re-open / close issues (right click)</li>
    <li>Edit issues (double click)</li>
</ul>

Please, leave a comment or drop me an email with any issues/reports.

Note: this plugin requires intellij to be started with Java7 due to third party libs.

## How To

After plugin install, go to IDE preferences, and look for Gitlab Integration.<br>
You'll need the host and your API key from your gitlab (which you can find under Profile Settings -> Account)
